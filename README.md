# Thot tutorials
Welcome to Thot's tutorials!

These projects are designed to help you learn and explore the features of Thot.
**Each tutorial only takes 15 minutes**, so you can get up and running quickly, and learn in bite sized chunks.

The tutorials are divided by level, and each level has several projects to choose from.

+ **[Beginner](beginner):** Learn the basics of the Thot desktop app by building and analyzing your first project.
+ **[Intermediate](intermediate):** Learn some more advanced features of the desktop app, and start coding your own analysis using
Thot's API bindings (using the language of your choice).
+ **Advanced:** Coming soon...
